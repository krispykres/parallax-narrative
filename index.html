	  <p>quit a job i absolutely hated.</p>

	  <p>where i was before.. workplace culture was come in early, work through breaks and lunch, work late. benefits were 'meh' and vacation time was capped at 3 weeks, no pension. pay was ok though.</p>

	  <p>now, its a 7 hr work day, pension, decent benefits, 5 weeks vacation and 0 stress job. its been 10 years, i stilld ont make as much, but the work/life balance blows that out of the water, not to mention i wont be working until i am 60</p>

    <p>Stopped assuming that people’s thoughts about me were at all similar to that extremely critical voice in my head. It’s still somewhat of a struggle to stay positive... but, overall, being yourself and staying present when with others really reduces anxiety. “Peaceful” would be a good word to describe it.</p>

	  <p>To just chill out. 90% of the time, I mess things up not because they were difficult or impossible, but because of my own anxiety and perfectionism that led to procrastination. Honestly, just chill the f out. You're a small stardust skeleton in a huge universe, stop being dramatic.</p>

    <p>Making decisions based on what I really want, not on what I think others want or expect of me.</p>
    <p>It was always so easy to put others’ needs first, because it meant that I never had to take the trouble to figure out what I really wanted, or to negotiate with others to get it. Just go along with everyone else, that’s easy and makes you likeable. But it doesn’t make you happy, because it means your needs are often not being met.</p>
    <p>TL;DR: I emigrated based entirely on what I thought others wanted, and realised that was not a healthy way to make choices.</p>

	  <p>Taking fiber supplements.</p>

	  <p>I now shit like clockwork, twice a day, and even after a night of drinking, I have never had more than a 3-wipe to clean. I'll never go back to not taking them.</p>

	  <p>The quality of my shits has just been absolutely magical. I wish I knew of this sooner.</p>

	  <p>Try it for a month, you'll never want to stop. No more peanut butter in a shag carpet, no more mud streaks, no more wiping yourself raw, it's life changing.</p>

    <p>6 years ago I decided to never be late to anything ever again. My whole live up until that point I was always late to everything, school, birthdays etc. Anyway, making sure I'm on time saves me a lot of trouble and a lot of stress and anxiety. Also everyone I know (who has noticed it) really appreciate it. Being on time for plans shows that you care about people, and that they are important to you.</p>
